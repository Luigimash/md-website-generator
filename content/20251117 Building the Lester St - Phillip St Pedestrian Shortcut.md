An unspoken piece of infrastructure that most of the students at UWaterloo secretly want is a direct shortcut from Lester Street to Phillip Street, ideally close to the Hickory Street connection.

I found some other Reddit posts over the years as well:

And even people who made a creative trapdoor in the fence:

And, anecdotally, there have been many more holes in the fence between Lester Street and Phillip Street over the years. I remember when I was in first year (2021-2022), there was a gaping hole in the fence between 247 Lester Street and the Plaza that required you to make a 3ft jump up or down to cross it, and even that one had pretty decent foot traffic at all times of the day, even though it probably saved like 45 seconds of walking time. It's patched now though. 

# Context
For those that don't go to UWaterloo, or those who do but have only ever lived on Phillip Street, majority of the students that go to UWaterloo live to the east of campus, which is Phillip Street and beyond. 

The main complaint is that for anybody living east of Phillip Street, there is no way to cross Lester to Phillip (or vice versa) without walking all the way north to Columbia St, or south to University Avenue. Admittedly, it's not the longest detour in the world, but considering that Hickory Street is a convenient throughfare for all the streets going east, it's annoying to have a shortcut through everything, just to have to make a detour north or south anyways.
