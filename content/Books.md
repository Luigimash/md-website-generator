I read sometimes! Some of my favorite books:
> **All The Light We Cannot See** | Anthony Doerr

Fantastic historical fiction book set in WWII, telling a very compelling story from two distinct characters on opposite sides of the war. Favorite story of all time. There's a show for it now!

>**Atomic Habits** | James Clear

The book that's had the most impact on my worldview. I've been known to give people copies as gifts. 

>**Turn The Ship Around** | L. David Marquet

A surprisingly useful leadership book. Useful reading for anybody leading a team of any size, whether it's for a club or for a job. 

>**The Hate U Give** | Angie Thomas

Terrific story that gives a lot of perspective on the endless struggle with racism and police brutality that many black people deal with. 

>**Illuminae Files Trilogy** | Amie Kaufman

One of the best sci-fi thrillers I've read. 

>**The Three body Problem Trilogy** | Cixin Liu

The best sci-fi novels I have ever read. There are so many concepts, analogies, metaphors and plot points that make me go, "how did he come up with this?".

> **Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World** | David Epstein

An incredibly validating book to read. I've developed into an identity as a generalist, but especially as a young person in university, it seems that the most successful people around me are the ones who specialized early - people coding since they were 12, people that have been on track to become a robotics engineer for years, or business analyst, or entrepreneur, or anything else.

This book provides empirical evidence that there is nothing wrong with being a generalist - and, in fact, having a diverse breadth of experiences can empower you to think differently and accomplish unique things that no specialist could even dream of.
