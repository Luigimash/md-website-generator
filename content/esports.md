I've been working in esports since 2019, when I started an esports club at my highschool. Freelancing, observing, producing, collegiate, and leading students are all in my game.

Working and playing games, competitively and casually, has always been a big part of my life. Without it, I don't know who I would be today. 

While I'm not planning to actively pursue a career in esports anymore, the community still has a place near and dear to my heart. You can find me attending events and cheering on my friends in the industry. 

Some career highlights:
>**Student Director of Broadcast and Production,** [(UW) Warriors Esports](https://linktr.ee/uwesports)<br>*2021 - 2024*
