# Hello/Bonjour/你好!
I'm currently:
- Studying Mechatronics Engineering @ University of Waterloo, Class of 2027.
- Host at [Socratica](https://socratica.info). Directed the show for Symposium [W24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQFHZhmiJuA) and [W25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkJjbCQC_Qs).

I was once a freelance esports broadcast and events generalist. 

I don't yet know what I will be doing in the future, but I hope you're a part of it.

I'm always game for a good conversation. Hit me up if you want to chat about anything.
