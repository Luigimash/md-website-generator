# Preface
I’m working on an LED Matrix Phone Case, which is inspired by the AniMe Matrix from my ROG Zephyrus G14 Laptop.

I basically want to put a very similar type of animated LED display on a phone case because I think it looks cool, and I got a ton of comments about it when I used this laptop for several years. 

As of right now, it’s designed to fit the iPhone 17 Pro, although the main display board could fit on most iphones - the only thing that needs to be redesigned to fit every individual phone would be the flexible USB adapter board.

## November 7 - Update

The PCB boards arrived - pictures are of the main board. I still need to solder the flex USB board before showing how they connect.

I made a mistake with these pads though - I drew them as copper rectangles instead of actual SMD pads, and so I can’t solder anything to them without scratching off the top layer. I hope that this doesn’t ruin anything…

## December 31 - Update, 1.0 PCB order
The electronics for this project are split into two parts: a flexible PCB, which is used to mount the male and female USB receptacles, and the main display board, which is a rigid PCB used to house the main components and the LEDs.

I put in the order on JLCPCB for everything today - now just waiting for it to ship!
