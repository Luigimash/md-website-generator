*I wish to develop an analog audio mixer all-in-one solution that is custom designed with features to handle audio between casters, game, and production crew. Designed specifically for our school’s broadcast scenario, where we have two mic inputs + 2 headphone inputs, which need to be set to a different mix so that they can hear the game without game feeding back to the streaming laptop.*
