Worked on a cosplay arm for Viktor from Arcane/League of Legends alongside Jenna and Emanuel. Demoed at the W25 Socratica Symposium by Emanuel. I co-designed the mechanical structure, selected parts such as servo motors and lazy susan bearings, and did all of the electrical and firmware design, soldering, and programming.

See the [github](https://github.com/Luigimash/viktor-arm) here for the source files.
