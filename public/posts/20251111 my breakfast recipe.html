I've been eating the same overnight oats recipe every day for like 2 years now. I make it as the last thing I do every night before I go to bed. I find it's a good winding down ritual before I go to sleep, and there's something nice about making the last thing you do prepare you for the next day ahead.</p>

<p>I have never measured my ingredients so I'm going to use vague amounts like "a spoonful", but honestly the ratios of these ingredients are so subjective and you can add or remove most of these anyways.</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 Banana</li>
<li>1/2 spoonful of Peanut Butter</li>
<li>1/4 spoonful of Cocoa Powder</li>
<li>20-50g of Chia Seeds and/or Hemp Hearts or other seeds</li>
<li>Frozen Fruit (any kind - mix and match)</li>
<li>Oats (100-250g or so)</li>
<li>Almond milk (or milk or any other milk alternative - just don't use water)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Add a banana and half a spoonful of peanut butter to a bowl. Mix them together best you can (is much easier with a banana that is more ripe), you can use a fork or a spoon or any other method.<br>
Peanut butter and banana adds a bit of thickness to the oats, typically people use yogurt but I prefer this mixture instead.</li>
<li>Add your chia seeds, hemp hearts, or any other seed-like ingredients to the bowl and mix them in.<br>
These add fiber and extra micronutrients to the mix!</li>
<li>Dump a quarter spoonful of cocoa powder into the bowl. I don't usually mix it in at this step.</li>
<li>Add your oats - the amount is up to you, but somewhere between 100-250g is probably a good amount</li>
<li>Add almond milk (or any other milk substitute, including milk) until all the oats are soaking in it (not submerged!). Then crab a spoon and start mixing everything together!<br>
Most of the effort here is in mixing and soaking the cocoa powder, which might be a bit clumped.</li>
<li>Top with frozen fruit, nuts, or anything else you want to have with your overnight oats.</li>
<li>Throw the bowl in the fridge and enjoy the next day!</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy! Let me know if you try this :)</p>
