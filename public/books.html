    <p>I read sometimes! Some of my favorite books:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>All The Light We Cannot See</strong> | Anthony Doerr</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fantastic historical fiction book set in WWII, telling a very compelling story from two distinct characters on opposite sides of the war. Favorite story of all time. There's a show for it now!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Atomic Habits</strong> | James Clear</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book that's had the most impact on my worldview. I've been known to give people copies as gifts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Turn The Ship Around</strong> | L. David Marquet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A surprisingly useful leadership book. Useful reading for anybody leading a team of any size, whether it's for a club or for a job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Hate U Give</strong> | Angie Thomas</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Terrific story that gives a lot of perspective on the endless struggle with racism and police brutality that many black people deal with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Illuminae Files Trilogy</strong> | Amie Kaufman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the best sci-fi thrillers I've read.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Three body Problem Trilogy</strong> | Cixin Liu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best sci-fi novels I have ever read. There are so many concepts, analogies, metaphors and plot points that make me go, "how did he come up with this?".</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World</strong> | David Epstein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An incredibly validating book to read. I've developed into an identity as a generalist, but especially as a young person in university, it seems that the most successful people around me are the ones who specialized early - people coding since they were 12, people that have been on track to become a robotics engineer for years, or business analyst, or entrepreneur, or anything else.</p>
<p>This book provides empirical evidence that there is nothing wrong with being a generalist - and, in fact, having a diverse breadth of experiences can empower you to think differently and accomplish unique things that no specialist could even dream of.</p>
