  <main>
    <p>I wish to develop an analog audio mixer all-in-one solution that is custom designed with features for use to manage <strong>caster audio</strong>, ultimately to a USB audio interface. Designed specifically for our school’s broadcast scenario, where we have two mic inputs + 2 headphone inputs, which need to be set to a different mix so that they can hear the game without game feeding back to the streaming laptop.</p>
<p>Some of the features it will require:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individual cough &#x26; talkback buttons</strong> on the mixer, facing the casters
<ul>
<li>Can also add I/O screw terminals on the PCB for extended functionality maybe? or maybe a literal two-wire signal port for plugging in extra buttons?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Line outputs for individual microphone inputs,</strong> need to check if these are balanced/differential or if they are stereo
<ul>
<li>1/4” jacks, literally a 1:1 feed out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Master, Caster, Director mix outputs</strong>, with digital controls (on/off buttons &#x26; individual gain control) for sending audio from each input channel to each output
<ul>
<li>Two 1/4” monitor outputs for both (headphone level, not speaker level)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Four input channels</strong>, two for XLR caster microphones (non condenser) and one for 1/4” TRS balanced (differential) audio input
<ul>
<li>All inputs will be considered/assumed to be differential balanced cable audio, mono</li>
<li>No support for phantom power</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Master &#x26; Caster mix volume level LEDs</strong> (everything is assumed mono so one line of LEDs for both)</li>
<li>Ideally powered by USB-C port, for now can design with barrel jack w/ known power supply but change it to USB-C port + minimum wattage brick later</li>
<li>Appropriate potentiometers &#x26; faders for controlling volume and gain at every relevant stage
<ul>
<li>basically copy the UW mixer setup in terms of pots for pre-amp and faders for mix control</li>
<li>pots for aux mix, faders for master mix</li>
<li>only difference, have two output faders, one for master and one for casters</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
