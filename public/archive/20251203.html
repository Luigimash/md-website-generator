    <p>My birthday was about two weeks ago, so I'm now in the 22 club.</p>
<p>Something I've been thinking about recently is the relationship between my overarching goals and morals and the rigidity with which I stick to them.</p>
<p>This is, by no means, a guide to navigating this relationship; I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm slowly working on figuring it out.</p>
<p>I feel (and really by "I feel", I mean that in my perception and experience and mine alone), that in order to maximize my impact on the world and to bend some part of it to the values that I think are important, I have to, at times, selectively discard those values.</p>
<p>I think a great example of this is the desire for a clean earth and sustainable planet, and its direct conflicts with consumerism and the use of technology (and especially AI). I think that the short and long term impact of having our biggest corporations decide they need to start sourcing trillions of watts of power in the next several years in order to train AI, with the main value proposition of that AI being used to "automate" jobs, is really bad for the planet; socially, environmentally, and, potentially, financially.</p>
<p>That being said, I use LLMs like ChatGPT and Claude very regularly. It's very helpful for answering my questions when I'm studying, it can handle an open ended search query and trawl the internet much faster than I can, and it's pretty good at writing or reading code.</p>
<p>So isn't it very contrarian of me to use this thing that I think is bad for the world? What happened to putting my money where my mouth is?</p>
<p>There's a number of other things I can point to with similar negative properties that I still use. Social media, especially Instagram and X. I support right to repair, so I own a framework, but my phone of choice is still an iPhone. I still order products from Amazon, even though they have their own host of environmental issues and anti-union measures.</p>
<p>The reason I don't ditch these things is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don't believe my individual "vote" means anything. If I jump ship from X to Bluesky, it doesn't make a real difference to anybody but me. Same with Amazon, and same with whether I look up something on Duckduckgo instead of asking ChatGPT.</li>
<li>I'm a young guy that is learning how to navigate the world, and although I may have some preference for some of these services to not exist in the way they do today, the reality is they are here, and that means there's an opportunity cost to <em>not</em> using them.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the opportunity cost is something that is obvious; for most of these products, it's the whole point. We order stuff on Amazon because it's convenient, well stocked, and fast, and all of those things make shopping take less time and feel easier.</p>
